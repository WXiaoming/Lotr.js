Just another Promise/A+ lib

## Intro

Personal project to learn Promise by implementing. Thus, using for large-scale web application is not recommended. It's also a good example 4u to take a deep look at promise.

## Usage

[MDN Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
